# js-mini-projects

Welcome to my JavaScript mini-projects!! As an ardent high school sophomore who loves math and programming, I decided to create mini-projects with JavaScript. The purpose of this project is to document my learning journey and to actively engage in learning different programming languages on my own.

Each project consists of three parts: website, source code, and detailed explanation. By researching and reading different articles, I was able to build the projects. To document my though process and to optimistically contribute to the programming community, I wrote a detailed explanation for each script in my personal blog. However, because I was not enrolled in official course for computer science, the scripts may not be in their ideal state. Therefore, please feel free to leave any feedback or comments in my blog for each project for improvements!
